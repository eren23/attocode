# Minimal Swarm Config
#
# The simplest possible configuration — just enable swarm mode
# and let auto-detection handle everything else.
#
# Workers are auto-detected from OpenRouter (cheapest models with tool support).
# All other settings use defaults.
#
# Usage:
#   attocode --swarm .attocode/swarm.yaml "Build a REST API"

# That's it! No other settings needed.
# The orchestrator model comes from --model flag.
# Workers are auto-detected from OpenRouter.
# Budget defaults: 5M tokens, $10 cost cap.
# Throttle defaults to free-tier rate limits.
