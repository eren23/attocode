# Resume-Friendly Swarm Config
#
# Optimized for long-running tasks that may be interrupted.
# Persistence and checkpointing ensure you can resume from
# the last completed wave.
#
# Usage:
#   # Start a long task
#   attocode --swarm .attocode/swarm.yaml "Migrate codebase from CommonJS to ESM"
#
#   # If interrupted, resume with the session ID shown at startup
#   attocode --swarm-resume <session-id>

philosophy: |
  Make incremental, safe changes. Ensure each change is independently valid.
  Run tests after every modification. Prefer small, focused commits.

# restores task states and model health, and continues
