# Free-Tier Swarm Config
#
# Uses only free/cheap models with conservative rate limiting.
# Good for experimentation and learning without spending money.
#
# Usage:
#   attocode --swarm .attocode/swarm.yaml "Add unit tests for utils module"

# Enforce coding standards across all workers
philosophy: |
  Write clean, simple code. Follow existing patterns.
  Always run tests after making changes.
